In this project, I focus on using SQL to analyze the sales situation of a global store. <br>
The two main steps that I have done in this project are designing and creating a star schema on SQL for the store's data and executing query statements to analyze and gain useful insights from the data. <br>
**Dataset:** *Global-Superstore.xlsx*. Dataset about the sale situation of a global store. <br>
**FullScript.sql:** SQL script file using on this project.  <br>
**SalesAnalyzeReportStepbyStep.docx:** Docs file report. <br>
