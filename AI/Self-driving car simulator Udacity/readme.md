**In this project**, I use knowledge about convolutional neural networks _to train a self-driving car model using Keras_. <br>
The model _outputs a steering angle_ for an autonomous vehicle in each frame. <br>
Udacity provided a simulator where I could steer a car around a track for data collection. <br>
I use those data (images), and steering angles to train a neural network, and then use this model to drive the car autonomously around the track. (There are two tracks.) <br>
